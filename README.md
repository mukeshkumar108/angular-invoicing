## This is just a Test

I stumbled on this nifty little tool that allows users to create one-off invoices in the browsr, and print / save them as PDF's. [see original project](http://metaware.github.io/angular-invoicing) by Metaware.

I'm just playing around with it here.

## My Plans

* Update to AngularJS v2
* Add multiple currency support
